Find out why Indexer getting stuck and not moving during mid-match
Check pod 2 (BL) is fixed and get new offsets
Test if we can disable compressor if below 10V, and renenable if above 10V  (merger2_charAbsSW) 

Thur night:  Chris copy working code base to 2 usbsticks
             Create backup branch of working code base
             Make a copy branch labelled columbusDay1
             

Check if BLEncoder works and get new offsets
Check if tuning still good or need to retune (first Azimuth)
Check if teleop drive good
    if teleop bad retun (could be Azimuth, or Thrust if drift is bad)
Check if AutonExitTarmmac moves ~10feet.  Are we moving ~10ft?  Are we moving in right direction?
Check accuracy of auton rotate CMD
Check if Kyle's autons function correctly
