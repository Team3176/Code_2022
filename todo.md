Test if we can disable compressor if below 10V, and renenable if above 10V  (merger2_charAbsSW) 

Test "spin with origin at location of one of four selected pods."

Code new Climb logic (High Most Likely to be the one added)

Make Intake rejection system using color sensor (Rev color sensor v3)

Add intake guidance system.

Fix Defence Mode (current version set it to spin orientation)

Look into why the Indexer values stop updating

See why auto messes up after we deploy (low prio because we checklist after we deploy)

See if we have four falcons for the tank bot
    - If not add Sparks and NEOs

Monitor Mount (box tubing)

Speed Up Auton (5* Ball = ~20sec)
    - Speed Up AutonRotate (and keep accuracy)
    - Test TrapezoidRotate
    - TrapezoidDrive with a spin command
    - Speed Up TrapezoidDrive

Fix the NavX Offset (the reset in every auto is not very useful)

Machine Learning
    - Finish Training
    - Test on Robot

Target Tracking (If no target the spin correction doesn't take control) ***

Test if boosting the acceleration in turbo breaks the PID

Improve the bandwith of the camera
	- Remove unused SmartDashboard additions
	- Is SmartDashboard faster than Shuffleboard
